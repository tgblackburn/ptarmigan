Ptarmigan is a Monte-Carlo particle-tracking code, designed to perform precision simulations of strong-field QED in the interaction between a high-energy particle beam and an intense laser pulse.

Here you can find information about

* the [physics processes](physics.md) in Ptarmigan
* how to [build the code](build.md)
* how to [write an input file](input_guide/README.md)
* and how to [run a Ptarmigan simulation](run.md)
